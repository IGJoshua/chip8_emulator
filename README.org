* Chip-8 Emulator
This is an emulator for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8][Chip-8 platform]] written in Rust. It's the first large project which I've taken on in Rust and is how I've learned the language.

* Tooling
I've also written some tools which can be used in combination with this emulator, listed below.

** [[https://github.com/IGJoshua/chip8_assembler][Chip-8 Assembler]]
I've written an assembler to create binaries which can be executed by this emulator, available at the above link.
